# Master Thesis — Knowledge Graph Embeddings


**Summary**: Developed function-based knowledge graph embeddings (polynomial, complex number, neural network spaces) with Neural Architecture Search to optimize performance. Enhanced LLM grounding to reduce hallucinations.


## Highlights
- Function-based KGE families.
- NAS to automatically explore architectures.
- Integration with LLMs for factual grounding.
