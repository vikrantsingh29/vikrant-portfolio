# Google Analytics 4 Setup Guide

## 🎯 Overview
Your portfolio now has Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integrated to track real visitor data, user interactions, and engagement metrics.

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Create Google Analytics Account
1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Start measuring"

   - Website name: "Vikrant Singh Portfolio"
   - Website URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/vikrant-portfolio`
   - Industry category: "Technology"
   - Time zone: Your local timezone

### 2. Get Your Measurement ID
1. After creating the property, you'll get a **Measurement ID** (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
2. Copy this ID - you'll need it next

### 3. Update Your Portfolio Code
1. Open `index.html` in your project

3. Replace **GA_MEASUREMENT_ID** with your actual ID
4. Also replace **GA_MEASUREMENT_ID** in the gtag('config') line
5. Update `src/utils/analytics.js` and replace **GA_MEASUREMENT_ID** there too

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Replace GA_MEASUREMENT_ID with your actual ID -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC123DEF4"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-ABC123DEF4', {
    page_title: 'Vikrant Singh Portfolio',
    page_location: window.location.href
  });
</script>
```
